# wikijs-replit
hands-down, [wiki.js](http://js.wiki) is the best wiki software.  
- markdown (supports plain html if that's your style)  
- custom css  
- admin panel  
- support for heroku (and replit!)  
- free and open source  
- oauth2, like [discord](https://discordapi.com)  
- many integrations, like gitHub, s3, ssh  
- backups  
- analytics plugins, like google or yandex  
- more that i dont want to list  
## tldr, amazing wiki software.
their docs reccomend 1gb of ram, but replit only gives 500mb for free. a great solution is heroku, but if i want to deploy multiple instances, that makes heroku abuse harder :/. replit allows unlimited repls, so this script can run wiki.js on mysql local storage  

# warning
replit sometimes removes files that are changed too much, so i suggest backing up to github, s3, sftp, or another. dont blame me for data loss!  
i've also noticed, since you have less resources, replit is a little slower for rendering and page loads.  

## maybe ill put a wiki.js instance for this later, who knows
